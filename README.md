## This project is for learning TypeScript.

### What TypeScript? :dizzy_face:
- Open-source programming language from Microsoft.
- Typed superset of JavaScript.
- Compiled down to plain JavaScript which is understood by browser.

### Why TypeScript :raised_eyebrow:
- In general, variable in JavaScript is **dynamic type** that JavaScript doesn't know variable type until runtime.
- TypeScript is **static type** that knew variable type before runtime. so TypeScript able to handle type error better than js.

### Install TypeScript :construction:
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. Run command: **npm install -g typescript**
3. Run command: **tsc -v** (Optionals, to check typescript version.)

### Compile .ts file :rocket:
- Run command: **tsc [filename].ts** 
- TypeScript will build .js file, so you can run .js file by node using command: **node [filename].js**
